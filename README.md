This application uses the open weather API to get current and 5 day forecast information for the city searched by the user.

# KNOWN ISSUES

I'm not sure why, but the only way to make the last search show up on the main page is to refresh.
I tried using a setInterval for the function that loads them from localStorage, but it didn't work the same way that it worked for my other function that refreshes the searched list.

I also was not able to get the sidebar divs to be clickable, and I wasn't able to figure out why they didn't work. I tried putting the function inside a document.ready function but it didn't work as expected.

Rather than working on getting those working I have decided to move my attention to my group project.
